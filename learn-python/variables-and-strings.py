# Variables are like containers Store some data, pull it out later. They can hold all sorts of things like numbers, booleans and strings.
# Variable assignment it is a named symbol that holds a value.
# Varibles are always assigned with the varibale name on the left and the value on the right of the equals sign.
# Variables must be assigned before they can be used.
# Variables can be: assigned to other variables, reassigned at any time, assigned at the same time as other variables
# Variables must start with a letter or underscore, the rest of the name must consist of letters, numbers, or underscores and names are case-sensitive

# Data types in any assignment, the assigned value must always be a valid data type.
# bool  | True or False values
# int   | an integer (1, 2, 3)
# str   | (string) a sequence of Unicode characters, e.g. "Ledi"
# list  | an ordered sequence of values of other data types, e.g. [1, 2, 3] or ["a", "b", "C"]
# dict  | a collection of key: values, e.g. {"first_name": "ledi", "last_name": "hildawan"}

# Dynamic Typing is high flexible about reassigning variables to different types

# The special value: None
