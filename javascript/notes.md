Browser perform lots of different functions. They read and display content using HTML. They style HTML following CSS rules. And they add interactivity to a page by following the introcutions in a JavaSciprt program.

Every browser has something called a JavaScript interpreter built into it.
This is the part of the browser that reads and understands, and run the instructions in a JavaScript program. When a browser encouters JavaScript programming, the JavaScript interpreter looks a each statement in the program and does what the statement says to do.

When a browser follows the instructions in a program, it "runs" or "executions" that program.
